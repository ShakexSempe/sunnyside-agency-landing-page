## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Styled using SCSS variables, nested styles and variables.
- Parallax scrolling on the header element which also contains the navigation elements.
- Flexbox layout used in the about and footer portfolio section.
- CSS3 box shadows around contact and social media links
- Testimonal (#projects) section styled with CSS Grid.
- Responsive design.

### What I learned

I learned the importance of a good color theme and font weights in display information.

### Continued development

I would like to improve my css positioning. I'm also keen on learning about when best to use javascript and when is css alone adequate for a particular problem.
